## Summary
initiative bitcoin hackerspace network is a self-sovereign movement to connect bitcoin-focused hackerspaces across the globe into a decentralized network of physical locations. doing so allows bitcoiners from near and far to onboard near to them and enjoy a community far. By onboarding to a local hackerspace in **bithacknet**, users can enjoy the benefits of a safe and bitcoin-focused communtity in all hackerspace network cities. Alternatively, hackerspace leaders can rest assured that the out-of-towner standing in front of them has been vetted and onboarded by a network hackerspace they trust In this way, we can lower the barriers to entry for all who want to learn how to build and fulfill the promise of local, community bitcoin hackerspaces - building more builders - while making it easier for hackerspace leaders to do so.

## Goals
1. Publish open-source documentation to allow future hackerspaces the ability to onboard themselves (self-sovereign) into the network
2. Define clear business requirements with resepect to cross-hackerspace, intra-network memebership benefits
   - define business model
   - define cost structure and revenue shared / split
   - define benefits to members from one hackerspace to another
3. Define clear technical requirements (functional and non-functional) from the business requirements
4. Implement definitions from biz/tech reqs
   - define JSON schema representing a hackerspace's belonging to / membership to the network
   - define JSON schema for members + memberships
   - define protocol for storing and retrieving JSON schema
   - define protocol for proof request/response (request proof of membership/response with proof)
   - implement TBD primitives building a "one-click" hackerspace technical repo
   - research alternative protocols and interoperability with SSI/DIDs (e.g. nostr)
5. Scale all business and technical resources to the world onboarding all bitcoin hackerspaces
